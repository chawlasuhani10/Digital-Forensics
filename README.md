3 pieces of work in digital forensics:
1) hexdump: printing it, interpreting the hexdump in ascii
2) istat_ntfs: parsing the Windows New Technology File System (NTFS) including master file table (MFT) and individual istat entries.
3) partition_tables: breaking down master boot record and GUID Partition table (GPT) if it exists.
